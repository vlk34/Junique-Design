# Junique DESIGN
A Re-design of Junique Design's website. For practice.

-- @juniquedesign on instagram -- 

Saw that one of my favorite page's website was created by Wix, which I don't personally like. Decided to re-design it from scratch

All the navigations lead to nowhere and I'm planning on making this website a full functioning website. Still has lots of stuff to do and I'm new to this.

I just want to make a functioning website, even though the code might be "unusable", it will still work, just badly.
