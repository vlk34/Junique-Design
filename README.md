# Junique Design Website Redesign

## Introduction
This project is a redesign of the Junique Design website for practice. The original website was created using Wix, which I personally didn't prefer, and all the navigation links were non-functional. The goal is to create a professional and functional website from scratch. I have taken a break from this project as my university has started, it contains a small bug related with the responsiveness of the main header.
